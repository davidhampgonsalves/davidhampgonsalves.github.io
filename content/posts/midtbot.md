I build the wonderful [MidTBot](https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32) and have been enjoying creating pen plots.

My version abuses the tiny bot by extending the linear rods to give me a drawing size of 360x240 mm. 

Its brain is an ESP-32 running the flexible FluidNC which turns the GRBL into motor movements via two StepStick stepper drivers.

## Plots
Mostly I've been doing [procedurally](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/generative-surfboards) [generated](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/tree-rings) pieces but I also played with [3D vectorization](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cij38qeugss/) using Blender/Freestyle, [pixel art fills](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/plotted-pixels), [vector fills](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/Restaline), clear layer [topographic mapping](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMU1uBInvdj/) (of the moon) and lots more.

You can see more in my [IG](https://www.instagram.com/davidhampgonsalves/) or in my [git repo](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/plotter-art-archive) of past plots.
