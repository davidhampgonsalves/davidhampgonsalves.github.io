Cheap solar lights are nice but in cold climates short lived. If water doesn't corrode their circits then cold temperatures at low charge levels will destroy them. Its also in the winters when they can be the most enjoyable when the nights are long and a little extra light, diffused through a little snow would be helpful.

The easy way to circumvent these issues is to rip the guts out of an existing unit, replace its battery with a cheap (3-4$) 100F supercap and stick the whole thing in a glass jar. If your conditions are similiar to mine in Canada this will give you year round light for 5 years (and counting) without maintenence. 

If you want other options keep reading.
