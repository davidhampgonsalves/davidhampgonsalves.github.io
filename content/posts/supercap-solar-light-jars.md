In cold climates solar lights are convenient but typically short lived. If moisture corrodes their circits and cold temperatures at low charge levels will destroy the batteries. Its also in the winters when they can be the most enjoyable when the nights are long and a little extra light, diffused through a little snow would be helpful.

The easy way to circumvent these issues is to rip the guts out of an existing unit, replace its battery with a cheap (3-4$) greencap 100F supercap and stick the whole thing in a glass jar. If your conditions are similiar to mine in Canada this will give you year round light for 5 years (and counting) without maintenence. 

While this isn't optimal since these supercaps are rated at 2.7v which means if you are using a single AA battery solar light you are loosing about half its capicity. It is a super simple solution that in my experence nets great results.

In my case I enjoy building them from scratch using cheap Q5252f IC's so you can adjust the brightness and avoid throwing most of the light out. 

Its hard to say what will break first in one of these lights but the LED should last 50k hours and the supercap ~20k hours, so it'll probably be the lid of the bottle that finally fails.

I have used this circuit indoors with a candle flicker LED (more pictures on [IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHB5xssnfJC/)).

Also to fill a knot in my deck that lights up each night by cast the LED and circuit in resin with the solar panel under the board protected from the elements.
