In the 1990's Make Mag published a [article](https://makezine.com/article/technology/beautiful-solar-pendulum-build/) on building a solar pendulum. I love the idea of long lasting electro mechanical displays so I built my own version in the style of a clock pendulum. 

What I love about this device is that, since it closely converts light to movement, it is a great indicator of how intense the sun is and thus how hot it will be later in the day. Since it is in my room it gives me a surprisingly accurate way to plan my wardrobe choices even durring the seemingly bright yet cold months we have here in Canada.
