In the 1990's Make Mag published a [article](https://makezine.com/article/technology/beautiful-solar-pendulum-build/) on building a solar pendulum. I love the idea of long lasting electro mechanical displays so I built my own version in the style of a clock pendulum.

My version uses a knife edge bearing, a coil I wound myself and was made mostly from found materials (except a single transistor).

# Alternative Bearings
I also tested out some magnetic bearing designs but because of the tortional force induced by my pendulum design the knife edge bearing was better suited.
