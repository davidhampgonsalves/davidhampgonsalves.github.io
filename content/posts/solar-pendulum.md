In the 1990's Make Mag published a [article](https://makezine.com/article/technology/beautiful-solar-pendulum-build/) on building a solar pendulum. I love the idea of long lasting electro mechanical displays so I built my own version in the style of a clock pendulum. 

What I love about this device is that, since it closely converts light to movement, it is a great indicator of how intense the sun is and thus how hot it will be later in the day. Since it is in my room it gives me a surprisingly accurate way to plan my wardrobe choices even durring the seemingly bright yet cold months we have here in Canada.

My version uses a knife edge bearing made from coat hanger and a recycled shaving razor blade. I wound the coil myself using speaker wire and based its inductance off of a store listing for a similiar item. Everything else was made mostly from found materials (except a single transistor) but that was partially possible because I found some small pieces of nice hard wood a few weeks before.

## Alternative Bearings
I also tested out some magnetic bearing designs but because of the tortional force induced by my pendulum design the knife edge bearing was better suited.
