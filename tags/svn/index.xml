Libraries SVNKit was too low level for my(and I suggest most) needs. I found I was writing quite a bit of code for relatively simple actions.
SvnClientAdapter provides a simplified interface for either the cmd line client, SVNJavahl or SVNKit. Its my recommendation that for most projects this is the best way to go.</description></item></channel></rss>
