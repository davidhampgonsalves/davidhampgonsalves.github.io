I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an existing set that offered the scope I needed but I did find a set I liked. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the source now(if anyone does please let me know) but working from that I build up the missing entries. Since the weather is everyones business I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share them here.</description></item></channel></rss>
