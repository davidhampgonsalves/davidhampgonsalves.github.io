As someone who loves RSS(enough to write a Chrome Extension) but never liked Google Reader I&amp;rsquo;d like my turn on the soapbox.
Since my first usage of Firefox(ver 1.5) I have always loved its live bookmarks feature(but not the read/unread indicators).
RSS readers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be email clones. They should expect us to ignore items and act as a consistent, omnipresent and minimal interface to the internet.</description></item></channel></rss>
