First to organize your music Beets is amazing. Its light, easy to use and lets you tweek things exactly how you want them.
The limitation with Beets was that it was just an organizer and you still needed a full GUI application to conveniently find and play your music. This weekend I wrote the Play plugin which lets you harness the might of Beets queries and send those results to your choice of lightweight music player.</description></item></channel></rss>
