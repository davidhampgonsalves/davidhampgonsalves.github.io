This event brings people with ideas(sellers) together with people who want to chip in some money to get them started(buyers).
As a seller I had the opportunity to pitch my idea to each of the buyers as they came around. This was great practice and it allows you to test and tweek each variation of your pitch in rapid succession.</description></item></channel></rss>
